Product Review Analysis using NLP
(Project in final project folder)
The objective of this project is to analyze the reviews on a product and represent them in a
compact form to facilitate the process of checking out reviews for users to know the quality
and features of a product. Two approaches namely dictionary-based approach and machine
learning approach are used to get a better accuracy. The sub-objectives incidental to the main
objective are:
* Scrapping product reviews on websites featuring a product specifically amazon.com.
* Analyze and categorize review data.
* Categorization or classification of reviews into-
* Positive
* Negative
* Graphical representation of proportion of positive to negative reviews
